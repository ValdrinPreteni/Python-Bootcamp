Project 1: Coffee Machine (Print report, Check resources sufficient, Process Payment, Make Coffee)

This is a sample project how a coffee machine would work in python.
While the code is running we will have a menu that will ask us to use 1 of 3 options,
1) Make order
2) Show summary
3) Exit

Option 1 will open an item menu where it will ask us to add an item or if there is an item already added there is an option to show order which will tell us what we have chosen after that, process the order where it will tell the machine to make coffee and process payment and print the receipt for the client.

Option 2 will check resources are sufficient and will tell us if we have enough beans, milk, sugar ...etc in stock if there are no resources in stock then an error message will show up telling us that ingredients are out of stock.
